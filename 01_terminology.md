## Terminology

**Agile Development**: A framework for developing software in short, iterative cycles called sprints. Focuses on customer feedback and continuous improvement. It has the following benefits compared to the _Waterfall software development_ approach:

- Increased productivity and efficiency
- Improved communication and collaboration
- Enhanced customer satisfaction
- Reduced risk of failure
- Increased flexibility and adaptability

**Backlog**: A prioritized list of features and tasks to be completed in an Agile project.

**Code Review**: The process of examining source code to ensure it meets certain standards and best practices. It helps improve the quality and maintainability of the codebase.

**Code Snippet**: A small piece of code used to illustrate a particular concept or technique.

**DAST**: Dynamic Analysis for Security Testing, a type of security testing that uses automated tools to identify vulnerabilities in an application's code. Some of the open-source DAST tools are OWASP ZAP, Veracode SCA, and Burp Suite. This is a technique for testing web applications, mobile apps and APIs to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.

- Gartner predicts that by 2026, 50% of large global enterprises will use DAST as part of their security testing processes.

**DesignOps**: The intersection of design and operations, which aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of product development by integrating design thinking into the operational workflow.

**DevOps**: It is practice in which development & operations are not treated as separate.

**DevSecOps**: A set of practices that combines development and security into a single process. This approach aims to ensure that security is integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle, from development to deployment.

**GitOps**: A set of practices that aim to automate as much as possible, so that there's less room for human error and more time can be spent on high-value tasks. This enables teams to collaborate better and work faster.

**Kubernetes**: An open-source container orchestration system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

**OWASP**: The Open Web Application Security Project, an organization dedicated to improving the security of web applications.

**OWASP Top 10**: The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes an annual list of the top ten most critical web application security risks. DAST tools are used to identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers and prevent attacks on web applications, mobile apps and APIs.

- Gartner predicts that by 2027, 30% of large global enterprises will use OWASP Top 10 as part of their security testing processes.

**Pair Programming**: A programming technique in which two developers work together on a single task, sharing their screens and keyboards.

**Penetration Testing**: A simulated cyber attack on a computer system or network to test its defenses and identify vulnerabilities. Some of the open-source penetration testing tools are Nmap, Metasploit, and Burp Suite.

**Pull Request**: A request submitted by a developer to add new features or changes to an existing codebase. It is reviewed by other developers before being merged into the main codebase.

**Refactoring**: The process of improving the internal structure and organization of existing code without changing its external behavior.

**SAST**: Static Analysis for Security Testing - A type of security testing that uses automated tools to identify vulnerabilities in an application's source code. Some of the open-source SAST tools are OWASP ZAP, Veracode SCA, and SonarQube.

**Security Auditing**: The process of evaluating an organization's or system's security controls to ensure they meet certain standards and regulations.

**Security Testing**: The process of identifying vulnerabilities in a system or application to improve its overall security posture.

**Sprint**: A time-boxed period (typically 2-4 weeks) during which a team works on a subset of the backlog. The goal is to deliver a potentially shippable product at the end of each sprint.

**Sprint Planning**: A meeting at the beginning of each sprint to determine the tasks to be completed.

**Sprint Review**: A meeting at the end of each sprint to showcase the work completed and get feedback from stakeholders.

**Sprint Retrospective**: A meeting at the end of each sprint to reflect on what went well and what could be improved for the next sprint.

**Team**: A group of individuals with different skills and expertise who work together to achieve a common goal.

**Technical Debt**: The cost of implementing quick fixes or workarounds that need to be addressed later. It can lead to increased maintenance costs, decreased productivity, and reduced quality over time.

**Version Control System (VCS)**: Software that helps manage changes to source code over time. Some popular VCS tools are Git, SVN, and Mercurial.
