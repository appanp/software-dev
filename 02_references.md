1. [Gartner Identifies the Top Five Strategic Technology Trends in Software Engineering for 2024](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-05-16-gartner-identifies-the-top-five-strategic-technology-trends-in-software-engineering-for-2024), Gartner, May 2024
   - **AI-Augmented Development**: AI-augmented development is the use of AI technologies, such as generative AI and machine learning, to aid software engineers in designing, coding and testing applications. AI-augmented development tools integrate with a software engineer’s development environment to produce application code, enable design-to-code transformation and enhance application testing capabilities.
     - Because software demand exceeds most organizations’ capacity, existing developers are maxed out, unable to build features fast enough or find satisfaction in their work. AI coding assistants are emerging as accelerators, boosting developer productivity and happiness. By handling routine tasks, the assistants enable developers to focus on higher-value activities. This allows organizations to deliver more features faster with existing teams.
     - According to the Gartner survey, 58% of respondents said their organization is using or planning to use generative AI over the next 12 months to control or reduce costs.
     - Gartner predicts that by 2027, 50% of enterprise software engineers will use ML-powered coding tools, up from fewer than 5% today.
   - **Green SE**: Green software engineering is the discipline of building software that is carbon-efficient and carbon-aware. Building green software involves making energy-efficient choices for architecture and design patterns, algorithms, data structures, programming languages, language runtimes and infrastructure.
     - Gartner predicts by 2027, 30% of large global enterprises will include software sustainability in their non-functional requirements, up from less than 10% in 2024.
   - **Platform Engineering**: To help manage the complexity of the technology ecosystem, many digital enterprises are embracing platform engineering practices and establishing platform teams to provide consistent, integrated and secure platforms to their development and product teams. Platform engineering focuses on providing self-service tools, capabilities and processes that help platform users deliver business value, while managing cost and risk.
     - Gartner predicts that by 2026, 80% of software engineering organizations will establish platform teams as internal providers of reusable services, components and tools for application delivery.
   - **Software Engineering Intelligence**: Software engineering intelligence platforms provide a unified, transparent view of engineering processes that helps leaders to understand and measure not only velocity and flow but also quality, organizational effectiveness and business value.
     - Gartner predicts by 2027, 50% of software engineering organizations will use software engineering intelligence platforms to measure and increase developer productivity, compared to 5% in 2024.
   - **Cloud Development Environments**: Cloud development environments provide remote, ready-to-use access to a cloud-hosted development environment with minimal effort for setup and configuration. This decoupling of the development workspace from the physical workstation enables a low-friction, consistent [developer experience](https://www.gartner.com/en/software-engineering/topics/developer-experience) and faster developer onboarding.

[Gartner 2024 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies Highlights Developer Productivity, Total Experience, AI and Security](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-08-21-gartner-2024-hype-cycle-for-emerging-technologies-highlights-developer-productivity-total-experience-ai-and-security), Gartner, Aug 2024 - _four themes_ for emerging technology trends:
   - **Autonomous AI**: AI’s fast evolution is producing autonomous AI systems that can operate with minimal human oversight, improve themselves and become effective at decision-making in complex environments. These advanced AI systems that can perform any task a human can perform are beginning to move slowly from science fiction to reality. These technologies include multiagent systems, large action models, machine customers, humanoid working robots, autonomous agents, and reinforcement learning.
   - **Boost Developer Productivity**: Developer productivity is about more than writing code quickly. It’s influenced by developers’ effective communication and collaboration, and their feeling of energized focus, full involvement and enjoyment (being in the “flow state”).
   - **Deliver Human-Centric Security and Privacy**: Organizations will become more resilient by using security and privacy techniques that create a culture of mutual trust and awareness of shared risks between teams.
   - **Empower With Total Experience**: Total experience is a strategy that creates superior shared experiences by intertwining customer experience, employee experience, multiexperience and user experience practices. It uses technology to address critical interactions, empowering both customers and employees, with the goal of driving greater confidence, satisfaction, loyalty and advocacy. Technologies to assess include digital twin of a customer, spatial computing, superapps and 6G.
